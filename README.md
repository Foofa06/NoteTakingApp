# 💜 My Note Taking App 🎀

Hi! This is my SwiftUI note-taking app.

I built this app using SwiftUI for my indiviual assignment #2. It allows users to:

- Add new notes
- Edit existing notes
- Mark notes as completed and also incompleted
- Delete notes
- Save notes even after closing the app

Each note has:
- A title
- Content
- A completion status

The app uses JSON encoding with AppStorage to save all notes locally so they stay even after the app restarts.

## For Customizations I Added

- 💗 Pink and purple gradient background
- 💜 Custom styled note cards with rounded corners and shadows
- 🎀 Styled buttons with colors and icons
- ✨ Strikethrough + checkmark for completed notes

I also used NavigationStack to move between:
- The main list
- The detail view
- The add/edit screen

## Built With

- SwiftUI
- MVVM Architecture
- JSON Encoding
- AppStorage
